# Metadea — Architecture

**Status:** Active development (v0.3.64, shipping `.msi` releases)
**Architecture:** Tauri v2 desktop app — Astro + React frontend, Rust core, local SQLite — plus a small Cloudflare Workers service for account linking and an IGDB proxy
**Model:** Local-first. Personal library data never leaves the machine; a separate GitHub-based flow lets users propose shared catalog metadata (characters, relations, sagas).

---

## Overview

Metadea is a personal media library manager for anime, manga, light novels, games, visual novels, movies, series, comics and books. Almost everything — library entries, ratings, favorites, tier lists, the local metadata catalog — lives in a SQLite database inside the user's app-data folder, owned and read by the Rust side of the Tauri app. The web-looking frontend (Astro + React) is compiled into the native window; there is no separate web deployment.

A much smaller Cloudflare Workers service (`backend/`) exists alongside it, used for exactly two things today: proxying IGDB search (so regular users don't need their own IGDB/Twitch app credentials) and an optional Google account link. It is **not** where library data is stored.

```

The community catalog itself is distributed through git, not a database server — see [colaboracion_catalogo_git.md](./colaboracion_catalogo_git.md) (that doc predates the current `catalog/<Type>/` folder split and character-bundle support — treat it as the original design rationale, not a literal current file layout). In short: a user's proposed edit becomes a PR that writes one JSON bundle under `catalog/<Type>/*.json` (or `catalog/Characters/*.json` for a character); once merged, CI runs [scripts/build-database.js](../scripts/build-database.js) to rebuild `database.db` at the repo root, and every installed app downloads that file and merges in rows it doesn't already have (`sync_community_catalog` in `community_sync.rs`).

## Data Flow

### 1. Search (hybrid: live API + local catalog merge)

```
User types query
  → search() dispatcher in lib/search/index.ts
  → per mediaType, calls one provider in lib/search/providers/*:
      anime/manga/lnovel → AniList GraphQL (direct, public)
      game/vnovel        → IGDB, via Cloudflare Worker GET /api/search/games
      movie/series       → TMDB REST (direct, user's bearer token)
      book               → OpenLibrary REST (direct, public)
      comic              → ComicVine REST (direct)
      character          → fans out to AniList + ComicVine character search
  → in parallel, searchLocalCatalog() queries the local SQLite catalog
    (search_catalog Tauri command) and merges in local-only hits
  → results deduped by externalId, blocked entries filtered out
  → rendered as MediaCard grid
```

`game`/`vnovel` search is deliberately proxied through the Worker so ordinary users don't need their own IGDB/Twitch app credentials. The native Rust IGDB client (`igdb.rs`, `igdb_env.rs`) still exists and is used for catalog **moderation** (unfiltered search, candidate matching, forcing an IGDB id) in the admin panel, which does read locally-configured credentials.

### 2. Library Save (fully local)

```
User rates/favorites/tracks progress on a media
  → invoke('save_library_entry', { ... }) (lib/tauri/library.ts → user_library.rs)
  → INSERT/UPDATE into metadea.db, no network call
```

There is no cloud library sync in the current build — `POST /api/library/sync` in `backend/src/routes/library.ts` exists but nothing in `frontend/src` calls it (confirmed by grep). Treat it as legacy/dead code rather than an active sync path.

### 3. Community Catalog Contribution (GitHub-mediated)

```
User edits a catalog entry (media fields, relations, saga) or a character
(bio, aliases, appearances) via the admin panel or CharacterPrEditorModal
  → GitHub device-flow auth (github.rs) for a PAT-equivalent token
  → App creates a branch + writes catalog/<Type>/<external_id>.json (media)
    or catalog/Characters/<external_id>.json (character) + opens a PR
  → Repo owner reviews/merges from the same admin panel
  → CI (GitHub Actions) runs build-database.js on push to main → database.db
  → Every client's sync_community_catalog downloads and merges the new rows
```

A character's own file carries just its fields plus `appearances` (media it's in + role) — it has no owning `media_catalog` row, so it isn't nested inside any one media's bundle. Folder-to-type mapping lives in `frontend/src/lib/github/catalogPaths.ts`; `scripts/build-database.js` and `proposal_bundle.rs`'s dev-only local sync both sniff a file's shape (`character` vs `media_catalog` key) rather than trusting its folder, so they don't need their own copy of that mapping.

---

## API Integration Details

### AniList (GraphQL)
- **Endpoint:** `https://graphql.anilist.co`, no auth required
- **Media types:** anime, manga, light novels (`format: NOVEL` filter), characters

### IGDB (REST)
- **Default search path:** Cloudflare Worker (`backend/src/routes/search.ts` + `services/igdb.ts`), Twitch OAuth app credentials held server-side, token cached per warm isolate
- **Catalog moderation path:** native Rust (`igdb.rs`, `igdb_matching.rs`, `igdb_env.rs`), reads locally-configured credentials, used by the admin/catalog panel for unfiltered search, candidate matching, relation graphs

### TMDB (REST)
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`, bearer token supplied by the user
- **Media types:** movies (`search/movie`), series (`search/tv`)

### OpenLibrary (REST)
- **Endpoint:** `https://openlibrary.org/search.json`, no auth
- **ID format:** `/works/OL1234W`

### ComicVine (REST)
- Called from Rust (`comicvine.rs`); covers comic search, volumes, issues, issue cast/characters

### GitHub
- Device-flow OAuth for community catalog contributions (`github.rs`) — separate from the Cloudflare Worker's Google OAuth, and from the app's own local login
- README also mentions GitHub for "data backup"; not yet reflected in the reviewed code paths

### Steam / Epic / GOG / Xbox / EA (local platform scanning)
- `platform_scanning.rs` + `steam.rs` detect installed games and can launch them; Steam additionally supports achievements and owned-games lookups via the Steam Web API

### Discord
- `discord.rs` runs a background rich-presence updater

---

## Auth (three independent mechanisms, not one system)

1. **Local login** (`login.astro`): username only, stored as `offline_token` in the local SQLite via `auth.rs`. This is what actually gates the app today.
2. **Google OAuth** (`home.astro` → Cloudflare Worker `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` → Turso `users` table, JWT): optional "Vincular con Google" link surfaced only when the session is still the local `offline_token`. Independent of the Rust-side local login.
3. **GitHub device flow** (`github.rs`): scoped to the community catalog proposal/moderation flow, not general app auth.

Worth double-checking against current product intent: it's not obvious from the code alone why local login, Google linking, and GitHub auth are three separate token stores rather than one identity.

---

## Type System

### SearchResult (frontend, `lib/search/index.ts`)
```typescript
type MediaType = 'all' | 'anime' | 'manga' | 'lnovel' | 'game' | 'vnovel'
  | 'movie' | 'series' | 'book' | 'comic' | 'character';

interface SearchResult {
  externalId:   string;   // e.g. "anime:918" — matches media_catalog.external_id
  type:         MediaType;
  format:       string;   // "TV", "OVA", "MANGA", "base_game", ...
  source:       'anilist' | 'igdb' | 'tmdb' | 'openlibrary' | 'comicvine';
  titleMain:    string;
  titleRomaji:  string | null;
  titleNative:  string | null;
  coverUrl:     string | null;
  releaseYear:  number | null;
  releaseMonth: number | null;
  releaseDay:   number | null;
  scoreGlobal:  number | null;
  authorNames?: string[] | null;  // OpenLibrary only
  authorKey?:   string | null;    // OpenLibrary only
}
```

### Local catalog schema
The canonical schema lives in `src-tauri/src/db.rs` (`media_catalog`, `characters`, `character_appearances`, `media_relations`, `media_author`, `media_by_author`, `sagas`, `saga_relations`, plus per-user tables like `user_library`, `user_lists`, `tier_lists`). `scripts/build-database.js` maintains a hand-kept mirror of the catalog-side tables for the community database build — the two are documented as needing to be kept in sync manually, so a schema change in `db.rs` requires a matching change there.

## Rust Core Modules (`frontend/src-tauri/src/`)

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `db.rs` | SQLite schema + migrations, connection handling |
| `media_catalog.rs` | Catalog CRUD, health checks, community sync merge |
| `media_relations.rs`, `sagas.rs` | Prequel/sequel/adaptation graph, saga grouping |
| `characters.rs`, `staff.rs`, `media_authors.rs` | Character/staff/author records and appearances |
| `igdb.rs`, `igdb_matching.rs`, `igdb_env.rs` | IGDB client, candidate matching, local credential config |
| `comicvine.rs` | ComicVine client |
| `anilist.rs` | AniList token storage + profile lookup |
| `platform_scanning.rs`, `steam.rs` | Installed-game detection, Steam achievements/owned games |
| `folders.rs` | Folder picking, local anime scanning, launching games/VLC |
| `user_library.rs`, `user_lists.rs`, `user_metadata.rs`, `favorite_images.rs` | Per-user data: library entries, custom lists, favorites, profile images |
| `tier_lists.rs` | Tier list CRUD and placements |
| `episode_history.rs` | Local anime watch history |
| `community_sync.rs`, `proposal_bundle.rs` | Pulls/merges the community `database.db`, builds proposal bundles for PRs |
| `github.rs` | Device-flow auth + PR creation for catalog proposals |
| `auth.rs` | Local username/token storage |
| `discord.rs` | Rich presence |
| `utils.rs`, `vestigial_cleanup.rs` | Shared helpers; one-off cleanup of stale data |

---

## Known Issues & TODO

### Likely dead code
- `backend/src/routes/library.ts` (`POST /api/library/sync`) — no caller found in `frontend/src`; either wire it up or remove it
- `vestigial_cleanup.rs` — named and scoped as one-off cleanup; confirm it isn't still needed before assuming it's safe to delete

### Medium priority
- Three separate auth mechanisms (local, Google, GitHub) with no shared identity — worth a deliberate decision rather than accretion
- No automated tests found in `frontend/` or `backend/` beyond `vitest` being a backend devDependency (no test files located)

### Documentation debt
- `docs/CLAUDE2.md` (this file) previously described an early Cloudflare-Workers-only prototype that no longer matches the shipped app — now updated (2026-07-23)
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` / `docs/30_DAY_ROADMAP.md` describe a test-coverage and CI process not currently observed in the repo; worth reconciling or marking aspirational
